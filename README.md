# Overview

The calculator program in Rust is a versatile and powerful tool for performing basic arithmetic operations on numerical inputs. Its intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to perform quick calculations and retrieve results in a timely manner. The program's ability to handle multiple operands and operators, as well as its error handling and branching capabilities, make it a reliable and robust solution for many use cases.

One of the key benefits of the Rust programming language is its focus on performance and efficiency. The calculator program demonstrates this focus through its use of efficient data types such as floats and vectors, as well as Rust's built-in functionality for parsing strings and handling user input. These features ensure that the program can perform calculations quickly and accurately, even when handling large or complex inputs.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
